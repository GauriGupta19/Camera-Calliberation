# Camera-Calliberation
## Objective
To find intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration parameters of a mobile phone's camera.
## Background
The projection matrix depends on 11 parameters: 5 intrinsic parameters and 6 extrinsic parameters (3 for rotation and 3 for translation). The process of calibration of a camera consists in estimating its intrinsic
and/or extrinsic parameters.
1. Internal parameters of the camera/lens system. E.g. focal length, optical center, skew, aspect ratio etc.
2. External parameters: This refers to the orientation (rotation and translation) of the camera with respect to some world coordinate system.
